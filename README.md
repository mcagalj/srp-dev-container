# SRP Labs: Development Docker Container

The project includes a pre-configured Python development (Docker) container. By using a development container, each student will get the same dependencies, most notably the same Python version and the same Python packages versions.

To use it, you can either:

1. Click the following button:

    [![Open in Remote - Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/mcagalj/srp-dev-container)

2. Or, open up the repository in VSCode and follow the instructions therein.

For more information about developing in remote containers in Visual Studio Code, check out the [remote documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
