# SRP Labs: Development Docker Container 

The project includes a preconfigured Python development (Docker) container. By using a development container, each student will get the same dependencies, most notably the same Python version and the same Python packages versions. 

For more information about developing in remote containers in Visual Studio Code, check out the [remote documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
